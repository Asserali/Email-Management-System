## ðŸ”„ Sample Queries

### Select Users with Gmail:
```sql
SELECT * FROM UserR WHERE email LIKE '%gmail.com%' ORDER BY username;
```

### Join: Users & Accounts
```sql
SELECT 
    UserR.user_id, 
    UserR.username, 
    Account.account_id, 
    Account.status 
FROM 
    UserR 
LEFT JOIN Account ON UserR.user_id = Account.user_id;
```

### Admin Announcements:
```sql
SELECT 
    Announcement.announcement_id, 
    Announcement.title, 
    UserR.username 
FROM 
    Announcement 
INNER JOIN UserR ON Announcement.user_id = UserR.user_id;
```

### Aggregate Data:
- Total Users:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalUsers FROM UserR;
  ```
